# Introducing NoirMath

NoirMath is a powerful math library developed within the Noir framework. Noir, a Domain-Specific Language for SNARK proving systems by Aztec Labs, offers a simple and flexible syntax for generating complex Zero-Knowledge Programs (ZKPs) without requiring prior knowledge of the underlying mathematics or cryptography.

ZK programs allow for the generation of concise proofs for specific statements while keeping certain details concealed.

## Features

NoirMath offers the following mathematical domains:

- **Complex Number Library**: Perform operations such as addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, finding the magnitude, and calculating the square root of complex numbers.
  
- **Fast Fourier Transform**: A fast algorithm for performing discrete Fourier transforms.

- **Trigonometric Formulas**: Includes sine and cosine functions.

- **Floating Point Library**: Perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on floating-point numbers.

- **Square Root** of a number in a optimal way considering range and overflows errors.
