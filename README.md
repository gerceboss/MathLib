# AzMath

AzMath
is a powerful math library developed within the Noir framework. Noir, a Domain-Specific Language for SNARK proving systems by Aztec Labs, offers a simple and flexible syntax for generating complex Zero-Knowledge Programs (ZKPs) without requiring prior knowledge of the underlying mathematics or cryptography.

ZK programs allow for the generation of concise proofs for specific statements while keeping certain details concealed.

## Features

AzMath
offers the following mathematical domains:

- **Complex Math Library**: Perform operations such as addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, finding the magnitude, and calculating the square root of complex numbers.
- **Fast Fourier Transform**: A fast algorithm for performing discrete Fourier transforms and polynomial multiplications.

- **Trigonometric Formulas**: Includes sine and cosine functions.

- **Floating Point Library**: Perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on floating-point numbers.

- **Square Root** : In a optimal way considering range and overflows errors.

## Getting Started

To get started with AzMath
, follow these steps:

1. Install all dependencies:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gerceboss/MathLib.git
   ```

2. Install all dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

## Future Aspects

Implementation of FFT and Complex math encourages more development of ML model based calculations and opens new ways to verify the ML model based calculations.
